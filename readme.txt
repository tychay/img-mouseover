Embed a mouseover image into a regular image tag without resorting to hacky inline Javascript.

== Description ==

This allows you to create a simple image mouseover feature by adding properties to an image:

It understands the following properties:
*	img.class="mouseover" (activates IMG mouseover for this iagme)
*	img.oversrc (If specified, this rewrites the image on mouse rollover)
*	img.clicksrc (If specified, this rewrites the image on mouse click)
*	img.noresize (If set, this will make the image have the natural dimensions instead of the dimensions of the original image).
